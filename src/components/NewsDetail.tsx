      intro:
        "After two weeks of intense negotiations, the Global Climate Summit has concluded with a historic agreement that commits 195 countries to unprecedented climate action, marking the most significant environmental accord since the Paris Agreement.",
      hookContent: `
        <p>The agreement, dubbed the "Global Climate Resilience Pact," establishes binding commitments for carbon neutrality and introduces innovative financing mechanisms for developing nations to transition to clean energy.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Agreement Highlights</h3>
        <p>The pact includes several groundbreaking provisions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Carbon Neutrality:</strong> All signatory nations commit to carbon neutrality by 2045</li>
          <li><strong>Clean Energy Fund:</strong> $500 billion global fund for renewable energy transition</li>
          <li><strong>Forest Protection:</strong> Legally binding protection for 30% of global forests</li>
          <li><strong>Ocean Conservation:</strong> New international marine protected areas</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres called the agreement "a turning point in humanity's fight against climate change," emphasizing the legally binding nature of the commitments.</p>
        
        <h3>Implementation Timeline</h3>
        <p>The agreement will be implemented in phases, with immediate actions required within the first 100 days. Countries must submit detailed implementation plans by March 2024, with regular progress reviews every six months.</p>
      `,

        "Environmental groups have cautiously welcomed the agreement, though some critics argue the timeline may still be too conservative given the urgency of the climate crisis. The pact represents a significant step forward in global climate cooperation.",
